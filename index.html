    <p id="Tip1">Offer 3 Choices</p>
    <p id="title">As a fan of being researching by myself topics that sparks my curiosity and may help me on my career in the longrun, I found a book named "vendele a la mente, no a la gente" which in english means "sell to the mind, not to people" by Jurgen Klaric. The trick here consists in offering three alternatives and then telling to your prospect customer what to choose. Some use cases may be an online service that gives you the option of paying for the basic, the pro or the golden version and suggesting that the latter is the most frequently chosen.</p>

    <p id="Tip2">Court Attention</p>
    <p id="title">Unfortunately nowadays people's attention span is very limited, as in Coursera (Lecture 9) when the professor Yaakov Chaikin of Johns Hopkins University gave the recommendation of creating a special tag that redirects the user to a blank tab in case that you need to make a reference to another link. This reduces the risk of losing them in clickbaits of a site that isn't ours. But back to the main topic of neuromarketing, this tactic ensures that by delivering quality content, consistent value and features so unique of what you sell aids your brand to stand out.</p>

    <p id="Tip3">Loyalty</p>
    <p id="title">To achieve clientele fidelity, first you need to create trust and a psychological bonding by understanding the other person needs and wants. It's very important to have empathy on a non-transactional relationship where the common ground is to only give if you can take something back. Reason No.1 why this may be the most important principle in sales is because we as humans have a tendency of behaving under an emotional level, which means people buy in order to seek pleasure -or- to escape pain.</p>
